# Text Classification Flask API

-----

This project provides a simple yet effective **REST API** built with **Flask** for performing text classification. It's designed to take raw text input, process it using a pre-trained **scikit-learn** text vectorizer, and then classify it using a pre-trained machine learning model. This makes it easy to integrate text classification capabilities into other applications.

## Features

  * **Lightweight Flask API:** Easily deployable and scalable web service.
  * **Pre-trained Model Integration:** Seamlessly loads and uses your trained scikit-learn classification model.
  * **Text Vectorization:** Utilizes a pre-fitted text vectorizer (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer` or `CountVectorizer`) for consistent text preprocessing.
  * **Prediction Endpoint:** A dedicated `/predict` endpoint to classify new text inputs via a `POST` request.
  * **Robust Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages for invalid requests or missing model files.

## Technologies Used

  * **Python 3.x**
  * **Flask**: Web framework for building the API.
  * **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training and text vectorization.
  * **pickle**: For serializing and deserializing Python objects (models and vectorizers).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-classification-flask-api.git
    cd text-classification-flask-api
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

      * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can create one with:*

    ```bash
    pip install Flask scikit-learn
    ```

### Running the Application

Before running the application, ensure you have your **`model.pkl`** (the trained classifier) and **`vectorizer.pkl`** (the fitted text vectorizer) files in the same directory as `app.py`. If you haven't trained a model yet, please refer to the [Training Your Model](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23training-your-model-optional) section.

1.  **Start the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  The API will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You'll see output in your terminal indicating the server is running.

## API Endpoints

The API currently exposes one primary endpoint for classification.

### `/predict`

-----

  * **Method:** `POST`
  * **Description:** Classifies a given text input.
  * **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "text": "This is an example sentence to classify."
    }
    ```
  * **Success Response (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
        "prediction": "positive"
        // or whatever your model's output format is, e.g., [0], [1]
    }
    ```
  * **Error Responses (400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error):**
    ```json
    {
        "error": "Error message details"
    }
    ```
  * **Example using `curl`:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "What a fantastic movie!"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
    ```

## Training Your Model (Optional)

This project expects `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` to be present. If you don't have them, you'll need to train your own text classification model and save the model and its associated vectorizer.

Here's a conceptual example of how you might train and save them:

```python
# train_model.py (Example script)
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import pickle

# 1. Load your dataset (e.g., CSV with 'text' and 'label' columns)
# For demonstration:
data = {
    'text': [
        "This is a great product.",
        "I hate this, it's terrible.",
        "Absolutely amazing!",
        "Could be better, quite disappointing.",
        "Fantastic service and quality."
    ],
    'label': [
        "positive",
        "negative",
        "positive",
        "negative",
        "positive"
    ]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

X = df['text']
y = df['label']

# 2. Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 3. Initialize and fit the vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000) # Adjust max_features as needed
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(X_test) # Transform test data using the *fitted* vectorizer

# 4. Train your classification model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000) # Or any other classifier
model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)

# 5. Evaluate (optional)
accuracy = model.score(X_test_vectorized, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# 6. Save the *fitted* vectorizer and the *trained* model
with open('vectorizer.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(vectorizer, f)
print("Vectorizer saved to vectorizer.pkl")

with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
print("Model saved to model.pkl")
```

Save this script (e.g., as `train_model.py`), run it, and then copy the generated `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` files into your `text-classification-flask-api` directory.
